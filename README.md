# DQN-Pytorch-SnakeDQN-Pytorch-Snake

Under the need of our homework of the "deep learning" course, we intend to build something both fun and meaningful.

DQN is one of the important parts of Reinforcement Learning field, which not specifically taught in class. We found some available materials and turtorials on the Net by ourselves,and made out a tiny project based on a classic game-SNAKE.With the help of DQN, the autoplayer can acquire the highest score,without failure.

There are still some parts existed that can be optimized,including the code and structure.We will keep improve the item as it  can be done.
